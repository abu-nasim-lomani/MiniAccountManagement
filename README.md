## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * .NET 8 SDK (or newer)
    * Microsoft SQL Server (2017 or newer)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your_GitHub_Repo_URL]
    ```

3.  **Configure Database:**
    * Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
    * In `appsettings.json`, update the `DefaultConnection` string with your local SQL Server details.
    * In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), create a new blank database with the same name used in your connection string (e.g., `MiniAccountManagementDB`).

4.  **Run Database Scripts (2 Steps):**

    * **Step 4.1: Identity Tables**
        In Visual Studio's **Package Manager Console**, run the following command to automatically create the ASP.NET Identity tables:
        ```powershell
        Update-Database -Context ApplicationDbContext
        ```

    * **Step 4.2: Application Tables & Logic**
        Now, to create all other tables (ChartOfAccounts, Vouchers) and stored procedures at once, simply execute the master script.
        -   In the project's Solution Explorer, find the script at: `/Database/Master_Setup_Script.sql`.
        -   Open this file in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
        -   Ensure your new blank database is selected.
        -   Click the **Execute** button. This single step will create all necessary tables and stored procedures.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    * Press **F5** or click the "Run" button in Visual Studio.

6.  **Create the First Admin User:**
    * The application has no default users. The **first person to register** will automatically be assigned the **Admin** role.
    * Click on the "Register" link on the landing page and create your primary account.
    * Log in with your new account to get full admin access. You can now create other users (`Accountant`, `Viewer`) from the User Management page.
